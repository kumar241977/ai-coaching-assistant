## üé® Customization

### Adding New Coaching Topics

1. **Update conversation_flow.py**:
   ```python
   "new_topic": CoachingTopic(
       name="New Topic Name",
       description="Topic description",
       initial_questions=["Question 1", "Question 2"],
       exploration_areas=["area1", "area2"]
   )
   ```

2. **Update the UI** in `templates/index.html`:
   ```html
   <div class="topic-card" data-topic="new_topic">
       <i class="fas fa-icon-name"></i>
       <h4>New Topic Name</h4>
       <p>Topic description</p>
   </div>
   ```

### Customizing Response Styles

Modify the response templates in `nlp_personalization.py`:

```python
"supportive": {
    "high_anxiety": "Custom supportive response for anxiety",
    "frustration": "Custom supportive response for frustration",
    # ... more templates
}
```

### Adding New ICF Competencies

Extend the `ICFCompetency` enum and add corresponding responses in `icf_competencies.py`.

## üîß Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development  # Linux/macOS
set FLASK_ENV=development     # Windows
python app.py
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Manual testing endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/start-session \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id": "test_user"}'
```

### Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following tables:

- **sessions**: Stores coaching session data
- **users**: Stores user preferences and profiles

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Setup

1. **Use a production WSGI server**:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
   ```

3. **Database Migration**: Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for production

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```
